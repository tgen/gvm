1. make sure you have the latest gcc module loaded (6.1.0 probably)

2. go to your gvm source tree, then cd src

3. modify Makefile.am:

OLD: gvm_CFLAGS = $(BASE_FLAGS) -g -O3
NEW: gvm_CFLAGS = $(BASE_FLAGS) -g -pg -O3

NOTE: leaving optimizations in will make it run quite a bit faster but
      has a chance of not telling you what you need to know. In this
      case, leaving it in for the first try is probably a good idea.

4. build and run gvm as usual (check the compile commands for -pg to
   make sure it generated the makefile correctly)

   <path_to_gvm_executable> <options>

5. if it exited with status 0, then run gprof:
   gprof <path_to_gvm_executable>
